# night-snilek-syntax theme

An elegant, cool and sober dark theme. Featuring mainly purple and blue.

Night Snilek syntax has been tested (and by tested, i mean: I like
the way it looks) only with javascript, coffeescript, jade and less, since
I code with those technologies on my day to day.

I've decided to publish'em because I wanted to share'em with the world. :)

I will be enhancing this theme, but I'm afraid it will be at a slow pace.
Although, this is a really good theme even as 0.1.0 is been published.

If you have more time than me, and even better ideas than those who habit my
mind, feel free to create as much pull requests as you want.

Last but not least, if you are wondering for the day version of this theme...

Its almost here! It has a high priority on the roadmap.

###Happy hacking!
