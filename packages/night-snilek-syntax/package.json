Featuring mainly purple and blue.\n\nNight Snilek syntax has been tested (and by tested, i mean: I like\nthe way it looks) only with javascript, coffeescript, jade and less, since\nI code with those technologies on my day to day.\n\nI've decided to publish'em because I wanted to share'em with the world. :)\n\nI will be enhancing this theme, but I'm afraid it will be at a slow pace.\nAlthough, this is a really good theme even as 0.1.0 is been published.\n\nIf you have more time than me, and even better ideas than those who habit my\nmind, feel free to create as much pull requests as you want.\n\nLast but not least, if you are wondering for the day version of this theme...\n\nIts almost here! It has a high priority on the roadmap.\n\n###Happy hacking!\n\n**Javascript code with night Snilek:**\n![Javascript code with night Snilek:](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BxsyPXvIcAAy-Mj.png)\n\n**Jade code with night Snilek:**\n![Jade code with night Snilek:](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BxsyPXvIcAAy-Mj.png)\n\n**Less code with night Snilek:**\n![Less code with night Snilek:](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bxs1G-cIUAAmiqs.png)\n\n**Coffescript code with night Snilek:**\n![Coffescript code with night Snilek:](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bxs2kqSIcAA0c91.png)\n",
